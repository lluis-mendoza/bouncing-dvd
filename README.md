# Bouncing DVD Logo

## Overview

 Ever found yourself staring at that classic DVD logo, wondering when it's going to hit the corner? Well, wonder no more! This project puts a fun twist on the usual DVD logo screensaver. Instead of just bouncing around randomly, our DVD logo has a mission â€“ it's here to tell you how much time is left before it crashes into a corner. Say goodbye to boring countdowns; this one comes with a side of excitement and a dash of nostalgia.
